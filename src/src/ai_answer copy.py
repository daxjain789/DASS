                "**Issue 1: Insufficient Resources Dedicated to Cyber Security**\n\n"
                "* **Description:** The Council has only one dedicated member of staff for cyber security, compared to peers who have 3-4.\n"
                "* **Severity:** High. This significantly limits the Council's ability to proactively manage cyber risks and increases the likelihood of successful attacks.\n"
                "* **Rationale:** Limited resources lead to a reactive, \"best endeavors\" approach, rather than a proactive and robust security posture.\n"
                "* **Fix Priority:** **Highest**. Addressing the resource deficit is fundamental to improving the overall security posture.\n\n"
                "**Issue 2: Inadequate Cyber Security Awareness Training and Communication**\n\n"
                "* **Description:** Cyber security awareness reminders are unstructured, infrequent, and not part of a formal training program.\n"
                "* **Severity:** Medium. Lack of awareness increases the risk of employees falling victim to phishing and other social engineering attacks.\n"
                "* **Rationale:** Employees are often the \"weak link\" in an organization's security. Regular, structured training is crucial to build a strong security culture.\n"
                "* **Fix Priority:** **High**. Implementing a formal training program and regular, targeted communication will significantly reduce human error as a risk factor.\n\n"
                "**Issue 3: Lack of 'Phishing' Exercises**\n\n"
                "* **Description:** The Council does not conduct regular simulated phishing exercises to test employee awareness and resilience.\n"
                "* **Severity:** Medium. Without testing, the effectiveness of awareness training and the Council's overall vulnerability to phishing attacks is unknown.\n"
                "* **Rationale:** Phishing is a highly common and successful attack vector. Regular simulations are essential to identify weaknesses and improve employee responses.\n"
                "* **Fix Priority:** **Medium**. While important, implementing phishing exercises can be done after establishing a baseline level of awareness through training.\n\n"
                "**Issue 4: Reliance on Capita for Cyber Security Management and Lack of Control Visibility**\n\n"
                "* **Description:** The Council relies heavily on Capita, a third-party IT provider, for cyber security but lacks visibility into some of Capita's controls.\n"
                "* **Severity:** Medium. This creates a dependency and potential blind spot in the Council's security posture.\n"
                "* **Rationale:** While using third-party providers is common, maintaining oversight and ensuring adequate controls are in place is crucial.\n"
                "* **Fix Priority:** **Medium**. Working with Capita to improve control visibility and potentially incorporating audit rights into contracts is important for risk management.\n\n"
                "**Issue 5: Infrequent Reviews of Privileged/Administrator Accounts**\n\n"
                "* **Description:** Reviews of privileged accounts are not formally scheduled or conducted regularly enough.\n"
                "* **Severity:** Medium. Infrequent reviews increase the risk of unauthorized access and misuse of powerful accounts.\n"
                "* **Rationale:** Privileged accounts are high-value targets for attackers. Regular reviews are essential to ensure only authorized users have access and that dormant accounts are disabled.\n"
                "* **Fix Priority:** **Medium**. Implementing a formal schedule and process for reviewing privileged accounts will reduce the risk of insider threats and account compromise.\n\n"
                "**Issue 6: Lack of Timeframe for Disabling/Removing Unnecessary Firewall Rules**\n\n"
                "* **Description:** No policy or documentation defines a timeframe for disabling or removing firewall rules that are no longer needed.\n"
                "* **Severity:** Low. While not an immediate threat, outdated firewall rules can create unnecessary complexity and potential security gaps.\n"
                "* **Rationale:** Regularly reviewing and removing unnecessary rules improves firewall performance and reduces the attack surface.\n"
                "* **Fix Priority:** **Lowest**. Establishing a process and timeframe for firewall rule review is a good practice but can be addressed after higher-priority issues.\n",
